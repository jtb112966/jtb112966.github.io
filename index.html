        <h2>About James Brown</h2>
        <p>
          My name is James, and at the center of everything I do is the love and support of my wife, Angela,
          and our beautiful family. They’re the reason I work hard, stay grounded, and always push to be better.
          Family is my foundation, and their encouragement has shaped every step of my life and career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve spent more than 30 years in industrial plant operations, heavy equipment work,
          mechanical maintenance, crew leadership, workflow organization, and administrative oversight.
          My career has been built around improving productivity, safety, and day-to-day efficiency.
          I’m not the kind of man who sits in an office and talks about how work should be done —
          I’ve lived it, fixed it, operated it, and led teams through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it's running equipment, troubleshooting machinery, or keeping production flowing, I bring the
          same steady, practical approach to every challenge. I take pride in mentoring others, maintaining high
          standards, and keeping a safe, efficient operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, the best part of my life is spending time with my amazing wife, Angela,
          and enjoying being with our wonderful family. They’re my strength, my motivation,
          and the heart behind everything I do.
